# Ready to get to work bringing agile to gov?

This is the project tracking space for [Agile Government Leadership](http://www.agilegovleaders.org/). 

[Agile Champions](http://www.agilegovleaders.org/about/agile-champions/) are those who want to contribute to our efforts to bring agile to government.

Anyone with experience in agile government is welcome to work on projects and help us come up with new ideas!

## Request membership. ##

If you aren't part of the Agile Government Leadership organization here on GitHub, send an email to [info@agilegovleaders.org](info@agilegovleaders.org). 

+ Introduce yourself – name, organization, role/position, and agile experience
+ Tell us your GitHub username and let us know you’re ready to get started
+ You will get an invite to join the AGL organization on GitHub

## Look in Projects first. ##

Now you’ll be able to see other members of AGL and add ideas. Click “Projects” in the top menu to see some of the things we are working on. Click into a particular project to view suggested tasks and ideas.

## Add new ideas or tasks. ##

If you have an idea for a project or task that doesn’t already exist, you can add one by clicking “Issues” in the top menu and then “New Issue.” Don’t be shy about submitting an idea — we will work with you to figure out logistics and collaboration opportunities. 

Give your idea a title. Then add a comment to explain some details. Writing a user story here would be helpful so anyone reading it will understand what you want to do and what value it has. (For example, "As an Agile Champion with procurement experience, I want to add some resources about agile contracting to the Agile Government Handbook.")

Optionally, you can assign the task to yourself using the menu on the right, or add the "Help Wanted" label. Submitting the issue adds it to our backlog and we can discuss it at the meeting.

## You can assign a task to a project. ##

If you know that your idea belongs in a particular project, you can move it into the backlog for that project. **You must create the task first as described above.** Then click into the project where your task belongs (for example, "Content") Then click "Add Cards" in the upper right. Find your task (for example, "Write an article about user stories") and drag it into the backlog.

## Come to the meeting and get to work! ##

Once you have identified or added a task or project from the list that you want to work on, it’s time to start!

To discuss next steps and talk to others who may want to collaborate with you, plan to attend the Agile Champions meeting, held every Tuesday at 9:30PT/12:30ET (via Google Hangouts). Contact [Elizabeth Raley](elizabeth.raley@civicactions.com) for a meeting invite.

We are counting on Agile Champions to move the work of AGL forward in bringing agile to government. In the spirit of an agile stand-up, you are encouraged to attend weekly meetings while your project is in progress.

**Need help?** You can [contact us](info@agilegovleaders.org) anytime for help getting started.
